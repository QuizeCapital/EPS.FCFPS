## `Codes`

In this directory, I store two code files of this research project. One for datasets download and the other for
the actual project. Both codes were written in python.

***Data Extraction Code***

The code utilises a class function which consists of child functions that 
call both local and global variables .

The parent class function is called the 'Datasets' function where we set our global variables : 

The only subfunction of our class is called the 'getCleanedDatasets' function.This functions siphons raw datasets from financial modelling prep mainly historical price, eps and free cash flow .Takes global attributes of class and out puts a json file with cleaned datasets for each subfunction containing either fundamental item.

The 'getCleanedEpsData', 'getCleanedFreeCashflowData', 'getCleanedHistoricalPriceData', 'getCleanedFreeCashflowPerShareData', 'Surprise' under the 'getCleanedDatasets' function connects to financial modelling prep's Api
and gets eps, fcfpcs, price, fcf, and earnnings surpise data from various sections as bulk data. Takes original ticker data as parameter and returns returns each tickers data.

***Analysis Code***

The code utilises a class function which consists of child functions that 
call both local and global variables .

The parent class function is called the 'freecashflowpershareByEarnningspershare' function where we set our global variables : 

The first subfunction is called the 'universeAvgReturns' function.This function calculates the average return of our universe of about 3000 equities It takes our log return dataset from our global variables. Returns average of our universe 

The 'epsPctChange'  returns the percentage change of earnings per share of our stock universe. It takes the earnings per share data as an undeclared input 

The ''





Under the clean datasets subfunction, we 
    
There is a parent function under the class  function that 

The function get_eps connects to the financial modelling prep API and downloads earnings per share for as long as a company has existed and calculates the eps growth rate by utitlising the formula 

$$
\triangle eps = -[abs(\frac{eps^0}{eps^t})]
$$

where t = ending timeframe used for analysis

$$
growth = ((-[abs(\frac{eps^0}{eps^t})])^\frac{1}{t})-1
$$

The function get_eps_pctChange is where we group our eps into the respective market value quintiles. We do this by treating for extreme values (cutting off values at 95% and 0.5% ) respectively.We then find the percentage change in earnings and use the average of that as our quintile figures.

The function combiningEPSMarketValue combines these into a  dataframe where we get our output.
