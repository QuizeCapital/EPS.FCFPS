## `Codes`
In this directory, I store two code files of this research project. One for datasets download and the other for
the actual project.

***Datasets Code***

The code utilises a class function which is conisits of child functions that 
call both local and global variables .

The function get_eps connects to the financial modelling prep API and downloads earnings per share for as long as a company has existed and calculates the eps growth rate by utitlising the formula 

$$
\triangle eps = -[abs(\frac{eps^0}{eps^t})]
$$

where t = ending timeframe used for analysis

$$
growth = ((-[abs(\frac{eps^0}{eps^t})])^\frac{1}{t})-1
$$

The function get_eps_pctChange is where we group our eps into the respective market value quintiles. We do this by treating for extreme values (cutting off values at 95% and 0.5% ) respectively.We then find the percentage change in earnings and use the average of that as our quintile figures.

The function combiningEPSMarketValue combines these into a  dataframe where we get our output.
